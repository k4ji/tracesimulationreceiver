## Overview

The **Trace Simulation Receiver** generates synthetic trace data for testing, validating, and benchmarking
OpenTelemetry-compatible pipelines.

It simulates traces based on configurable blueprints, enabling teams to replicate distributed system behavior—including
service interactions, span timing, and error conditions—without instrumenting real services.

--- 

## Configuration

Refer to the [reference configuration](./reference.yaml) for detailed options, and see
the [examples directory](./example) for real-world usage patterns.

---

## Use Cases

- Benchmarking OpenTelemetry pipeline performance
- Testing OpenTelemetry-compatible backends such as Datadog, Dynatrace, Jaeger, Honeycomb, NewRelic, and Splunk (listed alphabetically) 
- Demonstrating trace correlation and visualization tools

---

## Getting Started

_A `Docker`-based quickstart will be added soon._

In the meantime, you can integrate the receiver into your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration and run it locally using the examples in [`./example`](./example).

## Stability

This receiver is currently in **alpha** and may undergo breaking changes.
