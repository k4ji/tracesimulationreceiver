## Overview

The **Trace Simulation Receiver** generates synthetic trace data for testing, validating, and benchmarking
OpenTelemetry-compatible pipelines.

It simulates traces based on configurable blueprints, enabling teams to replicate distributed system behavior—including
service interactions, span timing, and error conditions—without instrumenting real services.

--- 

## Configuration

Refer to the [reference configuration](./reference.yaml) for detailed options, and see
the [examples directory](./example) for real-world usage patterns.

---

## Use Cases

- Benchmarking OpenTelemetry pipeline performance
- Testing OpenTelemetry-compatible backends such as Datadog, Dynatrace, Jaeger, Honeycomb, New Relic, and Splunk (listed
  alphabetically)
- Demonstrating trace correlation and visualization tools

---

## Getting Started

### macOS and Linux (arm64)

1. **Start Jaeger** (with OTLP enabled):

```shell
docker run --rm --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```  

2. Fetch the example configuration file (defines a basic simulation setup):

```shell
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k4ji/tracesimulationreceiver/main/example/simple.yaml
```

3. Run the OpenTelemetry Collector with Trace Simulation Receiver:

```shell
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/simple.yaml:/etc/otelcol/config.yaml" \
  ghcr.io/k4ji/otelcol-tracesimulationreceiver:latest \
  --config /etc/otelcol/config.yaml
 ```

4. View the traces in Jaeger UI
   Open http://localhost:16686 in your browser.

You can also explore other simulation scenarios using the configurations in [`./example`](./example) as well.

### Other Platforms

1. Clone `otelcol-tracesimulationreceiver` repository to build the Docker image of the opentelemetry collector with the
   trace simulation receiver:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/k4ji/otelcol-tracesimulationreceiver.git
cd otel-tracesimulationreceiver
```

2. Build the Docker image (from the root of the repository):
3. Follow the same steps from the macOS/Linux section above, starting with Step 1 (Jaeger setup).
