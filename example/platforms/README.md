# Platform-Specific Examples

This directory contains example configurations for running the `tracesimulationreceiver` against various backend platforms.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* **Cost Implications**: Running the OpenTelemetry Collector with these configurations may **incur charges** depending on the backend service. Please ensure you understand the pricing model of the backend you are using before proceeding.

* **Environment Variables**: Each example requires specific **environment variables** to be set. Refer to the comments and documentation within each configuration file for details. Ensure these variables are defined in your environment before running the collector.
